	<p>Keep track of where all your time goes! TimeStamp provides an interface which makes it easy to enter and amend data in your calendar. This means you can use your calendar as a journal to accurately keep track of what you have done. 

	<p>TimeStamp takes data from your existing phone calendar and aggregates it by day, week or month to provide you with a summary of where you spend your time.

		The goal of this project is to develop a way to enable computers to examine a new piece of music and identify the composer or genre. Music fans often observe that as they listen to new pieces of music, they are able to classify that piece into a certain “genre”. We seek to find a systematic way for computers or machines that do not possess the intuitions we possess to identify which genre a song is from.			</div>
